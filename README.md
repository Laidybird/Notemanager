- git status - Check the status of the repository and see if there were any changes in files
- git add . - Add the files that were modified/created, so we can commit it
- git commit -m "message for commit" - Commits all the changes

# Deploiment to Heroku 

- The project was deployed on Heroku from the master branch. To do this, the following steps were taken:
from your terminal (CLI), create a requirements.txt and Procfile using these commands:#

-- pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt -- echo web: python app.py > Procfile

- Sign up and login to Heroku, create a new app

- Go to the Deploy tab and then Deployment Method and select Github

- From the dropdown menu under HTTPS copy the link

- Now on the IDE create a directory where you want to make the clone

- Type git clone and paste the link that you copy from step 3.


# Forking Repository 

## By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps:
